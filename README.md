# Life-Expectancy
This is my Data Science project to predict Life Expectancy of Botswana and South Africa using input factors such as HIV/AIDS, GDP per capita, alcohol and others.

I do realise the errors regarding copies of dataframes could be fixed by using the proper copying functions but am afraid of breaking the code, and thus I shant.
